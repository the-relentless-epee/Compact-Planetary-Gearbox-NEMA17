# Compact-Planetary-Gearbox-NEMA17
A compact, fully 3D printed 4:1 planetary gearbox for a NEMA17 stepper motor. Uses **no hardware except for 4 screws**.

## printing:

- all model files are oriented the right way for slicing. "top cover + carrier" is a print-in-place model so do not separate the parts.
- minimal support is needed on the screw hole tabs of "top cover + carrier". Manual support painting recommended.

### Printer Requirements:
- designed for FDM printing with 0.4mm nozzle
- capable of 0.2mm horizontal tolerance (any good modern printers like Bambu's or Prusa's should be fine)

### Material Selection:
- I printed everything in PLA which works. PETG is recommended for "top cover + carrier" for stronger layer adhesion.
    if using engineering materials like ABS, ASA or PA, make sure the print quality is still good to ensure tolerance

## BOM:
- 2 M3$\times$16mm screws
- 2 M3$\times$6mm screws
- Optional: M3$\times$5mm heat set inserts
